## Welcome to my Citrix PowerShell Repo

This is just some scripts I've created for managing my Citrix sites. Feel free to borrow and edit for yourself.

- Copy-folder
- Create-Reboot-Schedules
- Get-PublishedApp-byUserAccess

If you want to be added as a collaborator please send me your email or git username to: cdfranck@gmail.com 

I just added a few more
- Citrix_Services - it checks the Citrix Servers on the DDC and if not started it starts them. I did this on conjucntion with a scheduled task.
